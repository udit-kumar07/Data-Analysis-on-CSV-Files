# Data-Analysis-on-CSV-Files
In this task, I first created a sample sales dataset (sales.csv) and then loaded it into a Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas library.
I examined the data to verify its size, column types, and identify any missing values.
After that, I cleaned the data by making sure all columns had the correct data type and by creating a “Total” column to calculate sales revenue. 
I also converted the date column into a datetime format so that I could group sales by month and year.
Then, I used groupby() and pivot tables to analyze sales by product, category, and region.
Finally, I created charts with Matplotlib to show the top 10 products and monthly sales trends.
